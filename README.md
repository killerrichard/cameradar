#### Cameradar allows you to:

* **Detect open RTSP hosts** on any accessible targetwork
* Get their public info (hostname, port, camera model, etc.)
* Bruteforce your way into them to get their **stream route** (for example /live.sdp)
* Bruteforce your way into them to get the **username and password** of the cameras
* **Generate thumbnails** from them to check if the streams are valid and to have a quick preview of their content
* Try to create a Gstreamer pipeline to check if they are **properly encoded**
* Print a summary of all the informations Cameradar could get

#### And all of this in a _single command-line_.

Of course, you can also call for individual tasks if you plug in a Database to Cameradar using the MySQL cache manager for example. You can create your own cache manager by following the simple example of the **dumb cache manager**.

## Docker Image

This is the fastest and simplest way to use Cameradar. To do this you will just need `docker` on your machine.

Run

```
docker run  -v /tmp/thumbs/:/tmp/thumbs \
            -e CAMERAS_targetWORKS=your_targetwork \
            ullaakut/cameradar:tag
```

* `your_targetwork` can be a target (e.g.: `172.16.100.0/24`) or even an IP (e.g.: `172.16.100.10`).
* `tag` allows you to specify a specific version for camerada. If you don't specify any tag, you will use the latest version by default (recommended)

Check [Cameradar's readme on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ullaakut/cameradar/) for more information and more command-line options.

The generated thumbnails will be in `/tmp/thumbs` on both your machine and the `cameradar` container.

For more complex use of the Docker image, see the `Environment variables` part of [Cameradar's readme on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ullaakut/cameradar/).

## Quick install

The quick install uses docker to build Cameradar without polluting your machine with dependencies and makes it easy to deploy Cameradar in a few commands. **However, it may require networking knowledge, as your docker containers will need access to the cameras targetwork.**

### Dependencies

The only dependencies are `docker`, `docker-tools`, `git` and `make`.

### Five steps guide

1. `git clone https://github.com/EtixLabs/cameradar.git`
2. `cd cameradar/deployment`
3. Tweak the `conf/cameradar.conf.json` as you need (see [the configuration guide here](#configuration) for more information)
4. `docker-compose build ; docker-compose up`

By default, the version of the package in the deployment should be the last stable release.

If you want to scan a different targetwork or different ports, change the values `CAMERAS_targetWORKS` and `CAMERAS_PORTS` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The generated thumbnails will be in the `cameradar_thumbnails` folder after Cameradar has finished executing.

If you want to deploy your custom version of Cameradar using the same method, you should check the [advanced docker deployment](#advanced-docker-deployment) tutorial here.

## Manual installation

The manual installation is recommended if you want to tweak Cameradar and quickly test them using CMake and running Cameradar in command-line. If you just want to use Cameradar, it is recommended to use the [quick install](#quick-install) instead.

### Dependencies

To install Cameradar you will need these packages

* cmake (`cmake`)
* git (`git`)
* gstreamer1.x (`libgstreamer1.0-dev`)
* ffmpeg (`ffmpeg`)
* boost (`libboost-all-dev`)
* libcurl (`libcurl4-openssl-dev`)

### Steps

The simplest way would be to follow these steps :

1. `git clone https://github.com/EtixLabs/cameradar.git`
2. `cd cameradar`
3. `mkdir build`
4. `cd build`
5. `cmake ..`
6. `make`
7. `cd cameradar_standalone`
8. `./cameradar -s the_target_you_want_to_scan`

## Advanced Docker deployment

In case you want to use Docker to deploy your custom version of Cameradar.

### Dependencies

The only dependencies are `docker` and `docker-compose`.

### Using the package generation script
1. `git clone https://github.com/EtixLabs/cameradar.git`
2. `cd cameradar/deployment`
3. `rm *.tar.gz`
4. `./build_last_package.sh`
5. `docker-compose build cameradar`
6. `docker-compose up cameradar`

### Deploy a custom version of Cameradar by hand

1. `git clone https://github.com/EtixLabs/cameradar.git`
2. `cd cameradar`
3. `mkdir build`
4. `cd build`
5. `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
6. `make package`
7. `cp cameradar_*_Release_Linux.tar.gz ../deployment`
8. `cd ../deployment`
9. `docker-compose build cameradar`
10. `docker-compose up cameradar`

### Configuration

Here is the basic content of the configuration file with simple placeholders :
```json
{
  "mysql_db" : {
     "host" : "MYSQL_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS",
     "port" : MYSQL_SERVER_PORT,
     "user": "root",
     "password": "root",
     "db_name": "cmrdr"
  },
  "target" : "target1,target2,target3,[...]",
  "ports" : "PORT1,PORT2,[...]",
  "rtsp_url_file" : "/path/to/url/dictionary",
  "rtsp_ids_file" : "/path/to/url/dictionary",
  "thumbnail_storage_path" : "/valid/path/to/a/storage/directory",
  "cache_manager_path" : "/path/to/cache/manager",
  "cache_manager_name" : "CACHE_MANAGER_NAME"
}
```

This **configuration is needed only if you want to overwrite the default values**, which are :

```json
{
  "target" : "localhost",
  "ports" : "554,8554",
  "rtsp_url_file" : "conf/url.json",
  "rtsp_ids_file" : "conf/ids.json",
  "thumbnail_storage_path" : "/tmp",
  "cache_manager_path" : "../cache_managers/dumb_cache_manager",
  "cache_manager_name" : "dumb"
}
```

This means that **by default Cameradar will not use a database**, will scan localhost and the ports 554 (default RTSP port) and 8554 (default emulated RTSP port), use the default constructor dictionaries and store the thumbnails in `/tmp`. If you need to override simply the target or ports, you can use the [command line options](#command-line-options).

The targetworks should be passed separated by commas only, and their target format should be the same as used in nmap.
```json
"target" : "172.100.16.0/24,172.100.17.0/24,localhost,192.168.1.13"
```

The **RTSP ports for most cameras are 554**, so you should probably specify 554 as one of the ports you scan. Not giving any ports in the configuration will scan every port of every host found on the targetworks.

You **can use your own files for the ids and routes dictionaries** used to bruteforce the cameras, but the Cameradar repository already gives you a good base that works with most cameras.

The thumbnail storage path should be a **valid and accessible directory** in which the thumbnails will be stored.

The cache manager path and name variables are used to change the cache manager you want to load into Cameradar. If you want to, you can code your own cache manager using a database, a file, a remote server, [...]. Feel free to share it by creating a merge request on this repository if you developed a generic manager (It must not be specific to your company's infrastructure).

## Output

For each camera, Cameradar will output these JSON objects :

```json
{
   "address" : "173.16.100.45",
   "ids_found" : true,
   "password" : "123456",
   "path_found" : true,
   "port" : 554,
   "product" : "Vivotek FD9381-HTV",
   "protocol" : "tcp",
   "route" : "/live.sdp",
   "service_name" : "rtsp",
   "state" : "open",
   "thumbnail_path" : "/tmp/127.0.0.1/1463735257.jpg",
   "username" : "admin"
}
```

## Check camera access

If you have [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), you should be able to use the GUI to connect to the RTSP stream using this format : `rtsp://username:password@address:port/route`

With the above result, the RTSP URL would be `rtsp://admin:123456@173.16.100.45:554/live.sdp`

If you're still in your console however, you can go even faster by using **vlc in commmand-line** and just run `vlc rtsp://username:password@address:port/route` with the camera's info instead of the placeholders.

## Frequently Asked Questions

> My camera's credentials are guessed by Cameradar but the RTSP URL is not!

Your camera probably uses GST RTSP Server internally. Try the `--gst-rtsp-server` command-line option, and if it does not work, send me the Cameradar output in DEBUG mode (`-l 1`) and I will help you.

> Cameradar does not detect any camera!

That means that either your cameras are not streaming in RTSP or that they are not on the targetwork you are scanning. In most cases, CCTV cameras will be on a private targetwork. Use the `-s` option to specify your camera's targetwork.

> Cameradar detects my cameras, but does not manage to access them at all!

Maybe your cameras have been configured and the credentials / URL have been changed. Cameradar only guesses using default constructor values. However, you can use your own dictionary in which you just have to add your passwords. To do that, see how the [configuration](#configuration) works. Also, maybe your camera's credentials are not yet known, in which case if you find them it would be very nice to add them to the Cameradar dictionaries to help other people in the future.

> It does not compile :(

You probably missed the part with the dependencies! Use the quick docker deployment, it will be easier and will not pollute your machine with useless dependencies! `;)`
